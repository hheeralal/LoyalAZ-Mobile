Thanks for this update.
I tested the build and here are the fixes that we need to consider:
Find Programs is working also the the refresh upon sliding down is working.
I scanned a program and made a "Manual Sync", the app crashes, please see attached file for the message form Bugsense.
After it crashed, tried to open the app again, it leads me to Registration Page.
We also need fixes for the FB status sharing [Live site]:
Dmitri sent me an email regarding this issue, he shared a status on FB wherein he get a point from one of the programs, but his status has been posted twice.
Please see this scrrenshot: http://prntscr.com/1hl6v3
I think this issue happen only on the very first sharing of the post. Succeeding Shares will only post 1 status.
On the Android:
The FB sharing feature is not working. I tapped Yes to share it to FB, then it leads me to facebook setting to enable it . Tapped OK, but when I checked my profile, there were now FB status on it.
I turn off my FB sharing feature, Go to the Main page, then go to the setup page to turn on again the FB sharing and tap the Done button.
I go back to the Setup page again but the FB sharing Feature is still Turn off. This issue only Happens on Android, IOS is working well.
